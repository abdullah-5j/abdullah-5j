## 📌 About Me

> **"The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear."** — _Unknown_

I'm a passionate **cybersecurity beginner** with a deep interest in Linux systems, automation, and offensive security.  
I believe in **learning by doing** — breaking things, fixing them, understanding the *why* behind every vulnerability.

- 🧠 **Mindset:** Think like an attacker, defend like an architect.
- 🛠️ **Approach:** Hands-on labs, documentation, and repetition.
- 🎯 **Goal:** Build a strong foundation in Linux, scripting, and security fundamentals.
